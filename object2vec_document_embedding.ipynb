    "In this notebook, we introduce four new features to Object2Vec, a general-purpose neural embedding algorithm: negative sampling, sparse gradient update, weight-sharing, and comparator operator customization. The new features together broaden the applicability of Object2Vec, improve its training speed and accuracy, and provide users with greater flexibility. See [Introduction to the Amazon SageMaker Object2Vec](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/introduction-to-amazon-sagemaker-object2vec/) if you aren’t already familiar with Object2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how these new features extend the applicability of Object2Vec to a new Document Embedding use-case: A customer has a large collection of documents. Instead of storing these documents in its raw format or as sparse bag-of-words vectors, to achieve training efficiency in the various downstream tasks, she would like to instead embed all documents in a common low-dimensional space, so that the semantic distance between these documents are preserved."

    "We demonstrate how, with the new features, Object2Vec can be used to embed a large collection of documents into vectors in the same latent space.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the widely used Word2Vec algorithm for word embedding, a natural approach to document embedding is to preprocess documents as (sentence, context) pairs, where the sentence and its matching context come from the same document. The matching context is the entire document with the given sentence removed. The idea is to embed both sentence and context into a low dimensional space such that their mutual similarity is maximized, since they belong to the same document and therefore should be semantically related. The learned encoder for the context can then be used to encode new documents into the same embedding space. In order to train the encoders for sentences and documents, we also need negative (sentence, context) pairs so that the model can learn to discriminate between semantically similar and dissimilar pairs. It is easy to generate such negatives by pairing sentences with documents that they do not belong to. Since there are many more negative pairs than positives in naturally occurring data, we typically resort to random sampling techniques to achieve a balance between positive and negative pairs in the training data. The figure below shows pictorially how the positive pairs and negative pairs are generated from unlabeled data for the purpose of learning embeddings for documents (and sentences)."

Because of continuing pressures upon the company , and difficulty finding investors , it sought bankruptcy protection under French law in January 2013 ; its subsidiaries in the United States have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection there as well .\tAll three subsidiaries have since exited bankruptcy , and are all going through a vigorous turnaround campaign .\tDuring their fiscal year meeting ( May 2009 ) , IESA announced that it would be changing its corporate name to an Atari-branded name , in line with the use of the name for its subsidiaries .\tIn reference to this , Atari , Inc .\t's CEO Jim Wilson said : `` We 've gotten rid of the Infogrames and Atari duality , the confusion around that .\tWe are one simplified company , under one management team , under one brand . ''\tInfogrames ' May 29 earnings report stated :\tA later July 24 earnings press release further clarified a name change from the May 29 report , with a change from Infogrames Entertainment , SA to Atari , SA It additionally stated the continued use of Atari Group for its Atari-branded and related subsidiaries .\tOn April 19 , 2010 , Atari , SA announced Nolan Bushnell along with Tim Virden would join the company 's Board of Directors .\tAs of March 31 , 2011 , the Board of Directors consisted of Frank Dangeard , Jim Wilson , Tom Virden , Gene Davis , Alexandra Fichelson.Jim Wilson ( COO )\tAs of August 2014 , the Board of Directors consisted of Frédéric Chesnais ( chairman ) , Frank Dangeard , Tom Virden , Erik Euvrard , and Alyssa Padia Walles .\tOn October 21 , 2010 , Atari announced Atari 's reference shareholders BlueBay Value Recovery ( Master ) Fund Limited and BlueBay Multi-Strategy ( Master ) Fund Limited are exploring a disposal of the shares and equity-linked instruments held by them .\tHowever , BlueBay shareholders later interrupted the sale process of its holding in Atari .\tBlueBay later converted the conversion of a portion of the ORANEs held by them .\tIn 2012 , Atari , SA , BlueBay Value Recovery ( Master ) Fund Limited , and The BlueBay Multi-Strategy ( Master )\tFund Limited reached an agreement following their negotiations regarding the restructuring of the debt and capital structure of the Atari group .\tAs part of the agreement , the €20.9 million Credit Facility Agreement was extinguished via €10.9 million loan forgiveness from BlueBay Value Recovery ( Master ) Fund Limited and Atari 's payment of €10 million ; the cancellation of the dilutive effect of the ORANEs held by BlueBay ; €20 million capital increases to be submitted to the vote of Atari shareholders ( of which €10 million with preferential subscription right ) .\tOn January 21 , 2013 , Atari , Inc. , Atari Interactive , Inc. , Humongous , Inc .\tand California US Holdings , Inc .\t( collectively , the `` Companies '' ) filed petitions for relief under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York .\tIn July 2013 , Atari began to sell its game assets , developers and the famous tripod logo and the Atari name in auction .\tThe Battlezone and Moonbase Commander games were bought by Rebellion Developments .\tThe Backyard Sports franchise was sold to Epic Gear LLC and later to Day 6 Sports Group LLC .\tTommo , Inc .\tbought Humongous Inc .\tand over 300 different games ( Including games from the company Accolade and Math Grand Prix . )\tTotal Annihilation was sold to Wargaming and lastly , Star Control was bought by Stardock .\tAtari also had plans to sell off the Test Drive and Roller Coaster Tycoon franchises .\tEden Games also closed down during the Bankruptcy , but reopened up a year later as an independent developer .\tin 2014 , All 3 Ataris emerged from bankruptcy and entered the social casino gaming industry with Atari Casino .\tFrédéric Chesnais , who now heads all three companies , stated their entire operations consist of a staff of 10 people .\tIn December 2016 , 3 years after the Bankruptcy sale , Atari sold the Test Drive franchise to BigBen Interactive .\tIn 2015 , Atari announced a turnaround strategy that would focus on re-releasing the catalog of Atari games .\tThe strategy is focused on `` download games , MMO games , mobile games and licensing activities , based in priority around traditional franchises . ''\tProjects currently in production or included in the turnaround strategy include :\tAtari 's overall strategy has four main focuses :\tThese were studios that were either formally apart of Infogrames Entertainment , SA , GT Interactive , Hasbro Interactive or associated with the Atari name .\n",
